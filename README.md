## ✨ Introduction

**AI Resume Analyzer** is a modern web application designed to help users assess their resumes with AI capabilities—directly from the browser. The platform enables secure resume uploads, AI-powered job-to-resume matching, personalized feedback, and ATS score evaluations. The entire experience is built using cutting-edge technologies without relying on a backend—powered by Puter.js.

I built this project to explore seamless frontend development with React and TypeScript while integrating serverless storage, authentication, and AI tools.
